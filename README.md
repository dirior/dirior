For: "Decide which tool you would use. Explain and justify your answer. (This is important, as you will be using this tool later!)" >>>
This is a README.md which means that what I write here goes on my profile.
This is an interesting way of using code for fun things like creating public profiles that others can see. I can write things like my name, what I like to do, and other things.
The only reason I answered the first two "questions" was for demonstration. There are many features and things you can do on GitHub which is listed in the menu.
GitHub really takes coding to the next level, because verything is a lot easier and simpler than other coding websites.
On other websites that I have tried I have noticed that there aren't as many indicators helping you like there are here on GitHub.

For example >>< <!--- dirior/dirior is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes. --->

This was like an instruction or hint made by the website to help you get started and undertand that you can do here. 
A few other AI coding sites that I tried before this one did not havee this feature.
This is why I chose GitHub. GitHub really takes coding to another level, just like it said it would.
